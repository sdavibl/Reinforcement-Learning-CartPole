# CartPole-V1 with Reinforcement Learning

This project applies Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to solve the classic CartPole problem using Reinforcement Learning. PPO is a policy gradient method that balances exploration and exploitation by optimizing policies in a stable and efficient manner. It uses a clipped objective function to prevent large updates, improving training stability. The agent is trained to balance the pole on a moving cart, demonstrating fundamental RL concepts. The model is developed using Stable-Baselines3 and OpenAI Gym, showcasing practical applications of deep reinforcement learning.
